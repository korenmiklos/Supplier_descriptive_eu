               propagate in production networks. We identify idiosyncratic
               shocks with the occurrence of natural disasters. We find that
               affected suppliers impose substantial output losses on their
               customers, especially when they produce specific inputs. These
               output losses translate into significant market value losses,
               and they spill over to other suppliers. Our point estimates are
               economically large, suggesting that input specificity is an
               important determinant of the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks
               in the economy. JELCodes: L14, E23, E32.",

  abstract = "Abstract Over the last decade the World Management Survey (WMS)
              has collected firm-level management practices data across
              multiple sectors and countries. We developed the survey to try to
              explain the large and persistent total factor productivity (TFP)
              differences across firms and countries. This review paper
              discusses what has been learned empirically and theoretically
              from the WMS and other recent work on management practices. Our
              preliminary results suggest that about a quarter of cross-country
              and within-country TFP gaps can be accounted for by management
              practices. Management seems to matter both qualitatively and
              quantitatively for performance at the level of the firm and the
              nation. Competition, governance, human capital, and informational
              frictions help account for the variation in management. We make
              some suggestions for both policy and future research.",
